Project Description: 

Our project is a web-based application through which we display an information hub for COVID-19.
Not only does it describe the symptoms and data of COVID-19, but allows viewers to be informed of the history and the 
available resources for COVID-19. As the coronavirus has been a major part of 2020, it is important for the world to be
aware of this deadly virus and make the right choices to stay safe. Our website offers safety measures and informs the 
public on tips to stay safe and keep others safe to fight the virus.

There are 5 tabs: 
1.The homepage(which is an introduction to what the virus is)
2.Prevention(How to prevent getting and spreading the virus)
3.Vaccines(Information about what vaccines are offered and the vaccine timeline)
4.History(A brief summary of the origin of coronavirus)
5.Other Resources(helpful resources with useful information)

We have all our source code files attached under project.
